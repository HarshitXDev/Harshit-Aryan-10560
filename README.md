# Online Food Order Simulation System

## Why I Made This Project

I created this project to practically apply the core programming concepts I have learned in C, such as **arrays, loops, and functions**. Instead of only solving small theoretical problems, this project helped me understand how these concepts work together in a real-life scenario.

Online food ordering is something we use daily, so simulating a simple food order system made the learning process more relatable and engaging. The main goal was to build logical thinking, modular programming skills, and confidence in handling user input and calculations.

## Project Description

The **Online Food Order Simulation System** is a console-based C program that allows users to:

* View a menu of food items with prices
* Select food items using their menu number
* Enter the quantity for selected items
* Calculate the total bill automatically

The project uses:

* **1D arrays** to store prices and quantities
* **2D arrays** to represent the menu in a structured (grid) format
* **Functions** to handles for taking orders and calculating the bill
* **Loops** to display the menu and compute the total amount


The program follows a step-by-step approach similar to real-world ordering systems but in a simplified form suitable for beginners.

## Utility of the Project

This project is useful in the following ways:

* Helps beginners understand **how arrays and functions interact**
* Demonstrates **modular programming**, making code readable and reusable
* Builds problem-solving skills using **real-world examples**
* Can be used as a **college or school mini-project**
* Serves as a foundation for learning more advanced concepts like structures, files, and databases

It also helps students gain confidence in writing complete programs rather than isolated code snippets.

## Future Scope

This project can be enhanced in many ways in the future, such as:

* Adding **GST, discounts, or coupons** to the bill
* Printing an **item-wise bill receipt**
* Using **structures** to store food item details
* Saving orders using **file handling**
* Creating a **menu-driven interface** with switch-case
* Converting it into a **GUI or web-based application** using other technologies

With these upgrades, the project can evolve from a basic simulation into a more realistic food ordering system.

## Conclusion

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of C programming fundamentals and showed how basic concepts can be used to solve practical problems. It is a simple yet effective learning project that can be expanded further as my programming skills improve.
